# Delete buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in OSS. Every object is contained in a bucket. This topic describes how to delete a bucket.

**Note:**

-   Before you delete a bucket, you must delete all objects in the bucket, LiveChannel objects, and fragments generated by multipart uploads. For more information about deleting a LiveChannel object, see [LiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md).
-   To delete the parts generated by multipart upload, use [ListMultipartUploads](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/ListMultipartUploads.md) to list all the parts, and then use [AbortMultipartUpload](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/AbortMultipartUpload.md) to delete these parts.

The following code provides an example on how to delete a bucket:

```
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/aliyun/aliyun-oss-go-sdk/oss"
)

func main() {
    // Create an OSSClient instance.
    client, err := oss.New("<yourEndpoint>", "<yourAccessKeyId>", "<yourAccessKeySecret>")
    if err ! = nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        os.Exit(-1)
    }

    // Delete the bucket.
    err = client.DeleteBucket("<yourBucketName>")
    if err ! = nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        os.Exit(-1)
    }
}
		
```
