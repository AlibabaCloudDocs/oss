# Delete buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in OSS. Every object is contained in a bucket. This topic describes how to delete a bucket.

**Note:**

-   Before you delete a bucket, you must delete all objects in the bucket, LiveChannel objects, and fragments generated by multipart uploads. For more information about deleting a LiveChannel object, see [LiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md).
-   To delete a bucket in which incomplete multipart upload tasks exist, you must first call `listUploads` and `abortMultipartUpload` to cancel the tasks.

The following code provides an example on how to call `deleteBucket` to delete a specified bucket:

```
let OSS = require('ali-oss');

let client = new OSS({
  region: '<Your region>',
  accessKeyId: '<Your AccessKeyId>',
  accessKeySecret: '<Your AccessKeySecret>'
});

async function deleteBucket() {
  try {
    const result = await client.deleteBucket('your bucket name');
    console.log(result);
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

deleteBucket();
		
```
