# Delete buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in OSS. Every object is contained in a bucket. This topic describes how to delete a bucket.

**Note:**

-   Before you delete a bucket, you must delete all objects in the bucket, LiveChannel objects, and fragments generated by multipart uploads. For more information about deleting a LiveChannel object, see [LiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md).
-   To delete parts generated in multipart uploads, call oss\_list\_upload\_part to list the parts. Then, call oss\_abort\_multipart\_upload to delete the parts. For more information, see [Multipart upload](/intl.en-US/SDK Reference/C/Upload objects/Multipart upload.md).

The following code provides an example on how to delete a bucket:

```
#include "oss_api.h"
#include "aos_http_io.h"
const char *endpoint = "<yourEndpoint>";
const char *access_key_id = "<yourAccessKeyId>";
const char *access_key_secret = "<yourAccessKeySecret>";
const char *bucket_name = "<yourBucketName>";
void init_options(oss_request_options_t *options)
{
    options->config = oss_config_create(options->pool);
    /* Use a char* string to initialize the aos_string_t data type. */
    aos_str_set(&options->config->endpoint, endpoint);
    aos_str_set(&options->config->access_key_id, access_key_id);
    aos_str_set(&options->config->access_key_secret, access_key_secret);
    /* Specify whether to use CNAME. 0 indicates that the CNAME is not used. */
    options->config->is_cname = 0;
    /* Configure network parameters, such as timeout. */
    options->ctl = aos_http_controller_create(options->pool, 0);
}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    /* Call aos_http_io_initialize in main() to initialize global resources, such as the network and memory. */
    if (aos_http_io_initialize(NULL, 0) ! = AOSE_OK) {
        exit(1);
    }
    /* Create a memory pool to manage memory. The implementation code is included in the APR library. aos_pool_t is equivalent to apr_pool_t. */
    aos_pool_t *pool;
    /* Create a new memory pool. The second parameter value is NULL. This value indicates that the pool does not inherit any other memory pool. */
    aos_pool_create(&pool, NULL);
    /* Create and initialize options. This parameter includes global configuration information such as endpoint, access_key_id, access_key_secret, is_cname, and curl. */
    oss_request_options_t *oss_client_options;
    /* Allocate a memory chunk in the memory pool to options. */
    oss_client_options = oss_request_options_create(pool);
    /* Call oss_client_options to initialize the client options. */
    init_options(oss_client_options);
    /* Initialize the parameters. */
    aos_string_t bucket;
    aos_table_t *resp_headers = NULL; 
    aos_status_t *resp_status = NULL; 
    /* Assign char* data to the aos_string_t bucket. */
    aos_str_set(&bucket, bucket_name);
    /* Delete the bucket. */
    resp_status = oss_delete_bucket (oss_client_options, &bucket, &resp_headers);
    if (aos_status_is_ok(resp_status)) {
        printf("delete bucket succeeded\n");
    } else {
        printf("delete bucket failed\n");
    }
    /* Release the memory pool. The memory allocated to various resources used for the request is released. */
    aos_pool_destroy(pool);
    /* Release the allocated global resources. */
    aos_http_io_deinitialize();
    return 0;
}
```
