# Delete buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in OSS. Every object is contained in a bucket. This topic describes how to delete a bucket.

**Note:**

-   Before you delete a bucket, you must delete all objects in the bucket, LiveChannel objects, and fragments generated by multipart uploads. For more information about deleting a LiveChannel object, see [LiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md).
-   To delete parts generated in incomplete multipart uploads, call [list\_upload](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/ListMultipartUploads.md) to list all the parts, and then call [abort\_upload](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/AbortMultipartUpload.md) to delete the parts.

The following code provides an example on how to call `Client#delete_bucket` to delete a specified bucket:

```
require 'aliyun/oss'

client = Aliyun::OSS::Client.new(
  endpoint: 'endpoint',
  access_key_id: 'AccessKeyId', access_key_secret: 'AccessKeySecret')

client.delete_bucket('my-bucket')
		
```
