# Delete buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in OSS. Every object is contained in a bucket. This topic describes how to delete a bucket.

**Note:**

-   Before you delete a bucket, you must delete all objects in the bucket, LiveChannel objects, and fragments generated by multipart uploads. For more information about deleting a LiveChannel object, see [LiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md).
-   To delete the parts generated by multipart upload, use [ListMultipartUploads](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/ListMultipartUploads.md) to list all the parts, and then use [AbortMultipartUpload](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/AbortMultipartUpload.md) to delete these parts.

The following code provides an example on how to delete a bucket:

```
#include <alibabacloud/oss/OssClient.h>
using namespace AlibabaCloud::OSS;

int main(void)
{
    /*Initialize the OSS account information.*/
    std::string AccessKeyId = "yourAccessKeyId";
    std::string AccessKeySecret = "yourAccessKeySecret";
    std::string Endpoint = "yourEndpoint";
    std::string BucketName = "yourBucketName";

    /*Initialize network resources.*/
    InitializeSdk();

    ClientConfiguration conf;
    OssClient client(Endpoint, AccessKeyId, AccessKeySecret, conf);

    /*Specify the name of the bucket to delete.*/
    DeleteBucketRequest request(BucketName);

    /*Delete the bucket.*/
    auto outcome = client.DeleteBucket(request);

    if (! outcome.isSuccess()) {
        /*Handle exceptions.*/
        std::cout << "DeleteBucket fail" <<
        ",code:" << outcome.error().Code() <<
        ",message:" << outcome.error().Message() <<
        ",requestId:" << outcome.error().RequestId() << std::endl;
        ShutdownSdk();
        return -1;
    }

    /*Release network resources.*/
    ShutdownSdk();
    return 0;
}
```
