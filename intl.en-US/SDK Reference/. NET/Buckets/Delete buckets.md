# Delete buckets

A bucket is a container for objects stored in OSS. Every object is contained in a bucket. This topic describes how to delete a bucket.

For the complete code used to create a bucket, visit [GitHub](https://github.com/aliyun/aliyun-oss-csharp-sdk/blob/master/samples/Samples/DeleteBucketSample.cs).

**Note:**

-   Before you delete a bucket, you must delete all objects in the bucket, LiveChannel objects, and fragments generated by multipart uploads. For more information about deleting a LiveChannel object, see [LiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md).
-   To delete the parts generated by multipart upload, call [ListMultipartUploads](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/ListMultipartUploads.md) to list all the parts, and then call [AbortMultipartUpload](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Multipart upload/AbortMultipartUpload.md) to delete these parts.

The following code provides an example on how to delete a bucket:

```
using Aliyun.OSS;

// Initialize an OSSClient instance.
var client = new OssClient(endpoint, accessKeyId, accessKeySecret);

// Delete the bucket.
public void DeleteBucket(string bucketName)
{
    try
    {
        client.DeleteBucket(bucketName);

        Console.WriteLine("Delete bucket succeeded");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Delete bucket failed. {0}", ex.Message);
    }
}
		
```
