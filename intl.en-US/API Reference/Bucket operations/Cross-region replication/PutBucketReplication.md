PutBucketReplication 
=========================================

You can call this operation to configure cross-region replication (CRR) rules for a bucket.

Usage notes 
--------------------------------

CRR enables the automatic and asynchronous (near real-time) replication of objects across buckets in different OSS regions. Operations such as the creation, overwriting, and deletion of objects can be synchronized from a source bucket to a destination bucket.When you use CRR, take note of the following items:

* CRR is an asynchronous process. Based on the size of the data to replicate, it takes several minutes to several hours to replicate data from the source bucket to the destination bucket.

  

* The source bucket and destination bucket must be located in different regions and cannot have the same name.

  For more information, see [Cross-region replication](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Disaster recovery/Cross-region replication.md).
