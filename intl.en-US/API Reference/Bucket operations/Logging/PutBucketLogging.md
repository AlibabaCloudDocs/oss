# PutBucketLogging

Enables the access logging function for a bucket. When this function is enabled, OSS automatically records the details about the requests to this bucket, and follows the user-specified rules to write the access logs as an object into a user-specified bucket on an hourly basis.

**Note:**

-   When the source bucket is deleted, the corresponding logging rules are also deleted.
-   OSS generates a bucket access log file every hour. However, all requests during the hour may not be recorded in the log file, but may get recorded in the previous or next log file.
-   Each time OSS generates a bucket access log file, this is considered a PUT operation and the occupied space is recorded, but the generated traffic is not recorded. After log files are generated, you can operate these log files as common objects.
-   OSS ignores all query-string parameters prefixed by “x-“ but such query-string parameters are recorded in access logs. If you want to mark a special request from massive access logs, you can add a query-string parameter prefixed by “x-“ to the URL. For example, you can add mark `http://oss-example.regionid.example.com/aliyun-logo.png` by adding a parameter prefixed by "x-" as follows: `http://oss-example.regionid.example.com/aliyun-logo.png?x-user=admin`. The added parameter is ignored. However, you can locate the request by searching "x-user=admin".

## Request syntax

```
PUT /? logging HTTP/1.1
Date: GMT Date
Content-Length: ContentLength
Content-Type: application/xml
Authorization: SignatureValue 
Host: BucketName.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com
<? xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"? >
<BucketLoggingStatus>
    <LoggingEnabled>
        <TargetBucket>TargetBucket</TargetBucket>
        <TargetPrefix>TargetPrefix</TargetPrefix>
    </LoggingEnabled>
</BucketLoggingStatus>
```

## Request elements

**Note:** All PutBucketLogging requests must signed because the anonymous access is not supported.

|Element|Type|Required|Description|
|-------|----|--------|-----------|
|BucketLoggingStatus|Container|Yes|Specifies the container for storing access log status information Sub-node: LoggingEnabled

Parent node: None |
|LoggingEnabled|Container|No|Specifies the container for storing access log information. This element is required only when server access logging is enabled. Sub-node: TargetBucket, TargetPrefix

Parent node: BucketLoggingStatus |
|TargetBucket|String|This element is required when server access logging is enabled|Specifies the bucket for storing access logs. The source bucket and target bucket can be the same or different buckets. You can save logs from multiple source buckets to the same target bucket \(in this case, we recommend that you assign different values to TargetPrefix\). Sub-node: None

Parent node: BucketLoggingStatus.LoggingEnabled |
|TargetPrefix|String|No|Specifies the prefix of the names of saved access log files, which can be null. Sub-node: None

Parent node: BucketLoggingStatus.LoggingEnabled |

## Naming rules for the objects storing access logs

The format of an object name is as follows:

```
<TargetPrefix><SourceBucket>-YYYY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS-UniqueString
```

The following table describes the parameters in an object name:

|Parameter|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|TargetPrefix|Specifies the prefix of the object name.|
|YYYY-mm-DD-HH-MM-SS|Indicates the time when the object is created. YYYY, mm, DD, HH, MM, and SS indicate the year, month, day, hour, minutes, and seconds individually. For example: `2012-09-10-04-00-00`.|
|UniqueString|Indicates the unique UUID generated by OSS to identify a log.|

An example object name is as follows:

```
MyLog-oss-example-2012-09-10-04-00-00-0000
```

In the preceding example, MyLog- is the prefix specified by the user, oss-example is the name of the source bucket, 2012-09-10-04-00-00 is the time when the object is created, and 0000 is the UUID string generated by OSS.

## Log file format

**Note:**

-   You may see “-“ in any field of OSS logs. It indicates that data is unknown or the field is invalid for the current request.
-   Certain fields are added to the end of OSS log files in future based on the requirements. We recommend that developers consider compatibility issues when developing log processing tools.

|Parameter|Example|Description|
|:--------|:------|:----------|
|Remote IP|119.xxx.xx.11|The IP address from which the request is initiated. The proxy or user firewall may block this field.|

|UserID|16571xxxxxx83691|The ID of the bucket owner.|
|Delta DataSize|280|The change to the bucket size. The value is a hyphen \(`-`\) if the bucket size does not change.|
|Sync Request|-|Indicates whether the request is a CDN back-to-origin request. The value is a hyphen \(`-`\) if the request is not a back-to-origin request.|
|StorageClass|Standard|The storage class of the current object. Valid values: `Standard`, `IA`, `Archive`, and `-`. The value is a hyphen \(`-`\) if the storage class information cannot be obtained or if the requested object is a bucket.|
|TargetStorageClass|Standard|The storage class converted to after a lifecycle rule is triggered or the CopyObject operation is called for an object. Valid values: `Standard`, `IA`, `Archive`, and `-`. The value is a hyphen \(`-`\) if the storage class information for the destination object cannot be obtained or the storage class fails to be converted by using a lifecycle rule or by calling the CopyObject operation.|
|oss\_acc\_src\_oms\_region|us-east-1|The endpoint when transfer acceleration is enabled. For example, if the access request is from the US \(Virginia\) region, the value is `us-east-1`. If transfer acceleration is disabled, or the endpoint is in the same region as the bucket, the value is a hyphen \(`-`\).|
