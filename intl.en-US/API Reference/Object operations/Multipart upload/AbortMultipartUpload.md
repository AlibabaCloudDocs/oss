# AbortMultipartUpload

You can call this operation to cancel a multipart upload task and delete the parts generated in the task.

## Usage notes

When you call AbortMultipartUpload, note the following items:

-   You must provide the upload ID of the multipart upload task that you want to cancel.
-   When you cancel a multipart upload task, parts that are being uploaded cannot be deleted.
-   After a multipart upload task is canceled, the upload ID of the task cannot be used to perform any operations and the parts uploaded by the task are deleted.
-   We recommend that you complete or cancel multipart upload tasks that are not complete in a timely manner because parts generated by these tasks consume storage spaces and incur storage fees.
