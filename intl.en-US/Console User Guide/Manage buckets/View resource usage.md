# View resource usage

This topic describes how to view OSS resource usage in the OSS console.

You can view the usage of the following resources in the OSS console:

-   **Basic Statistics**: includes **Buckets**, **Traffic Usage**, and **Requests per Hour**.
-   **Ranking Statistic**: includes **PV/UV** and **Rankings**.
-   **Region and Operator Statistics**: includes **Source Distribution** and **ISP**.
-   **API Statistics**: includes **HTTP Method Statistics** and **Status Codes**.
-   **Object Access Statistics**: includes the statistics for object access.

**Note:** **Ranking Statistic**, **Region and Operator Statistics**, **API Statistics**, and **Object Access Statistics** are supported only in regions in China, US \(Virginia\), US \(Silicon Valley\), and Singapore.

This topic uses **Basic Statistics** as an example to show you how to view resource usage.

1.  Log on to the [OSS console](https://oss.console.aliyun.com/).

2.  Click **Buckets**, and then click the name of the target bucket.

3.  Choose **Data Statistics** \> **Basic Statistics**.

    On the Basic Statistics tab, charts of **Buckets**, **Traffic Usage**, and **Requests per Hour** are displayed.

    -   **Buckets**

        Records the storage usage of the bucket for each period.

        |Basic data item|Description|
        |---------------|-----------|
        |Standard-Actual Storage Usage|The total storage of the Standard bucket.|
        |Storage Usage|The total storage of the bucket.|
        |Billed Storage Usage|The billed storage of the bucket.|

    -   **Traffic Usage**

        Records the traffic usage of the bucket for each period.

        |Basic data item|Description|
        |---------------|-----------|
        |CDN Inbound|The traffic that is generated when you use CDN to upload data to OSS.|
        |CDN Outbound|The traffic that is generated when you use CDN to download or browse data from OSS.|
        |Internet Inbound|The traffic that is generated when you upload data to OSS over the Internet.|

    -   **Requests per Hour**

        Records the number of requests initiated per hour to access the bucket. The statistics for **5XX Error**, **PUT Request**, and **GET Request** are collected.

        -   **5XX Error**

            Records statistics for 5xx responses returned when the client accesses OSS. Examples of 5xx HTTP status codes: 501, 502, and 503.

4.  Configure a time range to view resource usage.

5.  View statistics related to the basic data items based on different charts.

    The storage usage chart used in this example describes how to view statistics related to the basic data items.

    -   The display statuses of basic data items are shown in the lower-right corner of the chart. If a filled circle is displayed in front of a basic data item, related statistics are displayed in the chart. If an empty circle is displayed in front of a basic data item, the related statistics are not displayed in the chart.

        **Note:** By default, statistics for all basic data items are displayed.

    -   To specify whether to show statistics for a basic data item, click the circle in front of the basic data item.
    -   To specify whether to show statistics only for a basic data item or all basic data items, double-click the circle in front of the basic data item.
