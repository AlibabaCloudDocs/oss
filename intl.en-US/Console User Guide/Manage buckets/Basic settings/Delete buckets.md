# Delete buckets

If you no longer use a bucket, delete it to avoid incurring further fees.

-   All objects in the bucket are deleted. For more information about how to delete a small number of objects, see [Delete objects](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Objects/Manage files/Delete objects.md). To delete a large number of objects, we recommend you configure lifecycle rules to batch delete the objects. For more information about how to delete a large number of objects, see [Configure lifecycle rules](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Basic settings/Configure lifecycle rules.md).

    If versioning is enabled for the bucket you want to delete, make sure that all versions of objects in the bucket are deleted. For more information about how to delete all versions of objects in a bucket, see [Configure versioning](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Manage buckets/Redundancy for fault tolerance/Configure versioning.md).

-   Parts generated by multipart upload or resumable upload tasks in the bucket are deleted. For more information about how to delete parts, see [Manage parts](/intl.en-US/Console User Guide/Upload, download, and manage objects/Manage parts.md).
-   All LiveChannels in the bucket are deleted. For more information about how to delete LiveChannel, see [DeleteLiveChannel](/intl.en-US/API Reference/LiveChannel-related operations/DeleteLiveChannel.md) .
