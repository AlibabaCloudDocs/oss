2.  [t4333.md\#](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/OSS console/Create buckets.md)
3.  [Upload objects](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/OSS console/Upload objects.md)

After objects are uploaded to a bucket, you can perform the following operations:

-   Download the objects to local disks. For more information, see [t4335.md\#](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/OSS console/Download objects.md).
-   Generate signed URLs for the objects to share the objects with third parties for download and preview. For more information, see [t2009049.md\#](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/OSS console/Share objects.md).
-   Bind custom domain names \(CNAMEs\) to the bucket in which the objects are stored and access the objects by using the CNAMEs. For more information, see [Use custom domain names to access OSS resources](/intl.en-US/Quick Start/OSS console/Use custom domain names to access OSS resources.md).
