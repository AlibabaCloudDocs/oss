# API operation calling fees

Operations in Object Storage Service \(OSS\) are implemented by calling OSS API operations. Fees are calculated based on the count of API operation calls.

## Billable items

OSS charges API operation calling fees based on the count of API operations that you call to send PUT requests and GET requests.

|Billable item|Description|Billing method|
|-------------|-----------|--------------|
|Count of PUT requests|Fees generated when you call OSS operations to send PUT requests. The counts of failed and successful requests are calculated.|-   Pay-as-you-go: Calling fees = Actual calls Ã— Unit price per 10,000 calls/10000.

**Note:** You can call OSS API operations 50,000 times free of charge to perform operations on buckets located in the China \(Beijing\) and China \(Shenzhen\) regions. You are charged for additional calls.

For more information about the unit price of API operation calling fees, visit [OSS pricing page](https://www.alibabacloud.com/zh/product/oss/pricing).

-   Subscription: None. |
|Count of GET requests|Fees generated when you call OSS operations to send GET requests. The counts of failed and successful requests are calculated.|

**Note:**

-   Operations that you perform in the OSS console are implemented by calling OSS API operations. For example, GetService \(ListBuckets\) is called when you view the list of buckets. GetBucket \(ListObjects\) is called when you access the Files page on the OSS console. Therefore, OSS charges API operation calling fees for operations that you perform in the OSS console.
-   For more information about the operations used to sent PUT and GET requests, see [API overview](/intl.en-US/API Reference/API overview.md).
