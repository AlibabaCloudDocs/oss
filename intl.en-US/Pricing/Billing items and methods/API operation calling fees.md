# API operation calling fees

Operations in OSS are implemented by calling OSS API operations. Fees are calculated based on the count of API operation calls.

OSS charges API operation calling fees based on the count of API operations you call to send PUT requests and GET requests. For more information about prices, see [Object Storage Service Pricing](https://www.alibabacloud.com/zh/product/oss/pricing).

|Billing item|Description|Billing method|
|------------|-----------|--------------|
|Count of PUT requests|Fees generated when you call OSS operations to send PUT requests. The counts of failed and successful requests are calculated.|-   Pay-as-you-go: Calling fees = Actual calls Ã— Unit price per 10,000 calls/10000.

**Note:** You can call OSS API operations 50,000 times free of charge to perform operations on buckets located in the China \(Beijing\) and China \(Shenzhen\) regions. Additional calls incur fees.

-   Subscription: none. |
|Count of GET requests|Fees generated when you call OSS operations to send GET requests. The counts of failed and successful requests are calculated.|

**Note:** Operations in the OSS console are implemented by calling OSS API operations. For example, GetService \(ListBuckets\) is called when you view the list of buckets. GetBucket \(ListObjects\) is called when you access the Files page on the OSS console. Therefore, OSS also charges API operation calling fees for operations in the OSS console.

The following table lists the details of PUT and GET requests.
