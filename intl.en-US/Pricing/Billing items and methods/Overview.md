## Billing method

OSS supports the following billing methods:

-   Pay-as-you-go: Fees for OSS are calculated based on actual usage. You can complete the payment after a bill is generated. Fees are calculated based on the following formula: Fees = Actual usage Ã— Unit price. For more information, see [Pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing methods/Pay-as-you-go.md).
