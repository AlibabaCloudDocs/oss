# Overview

Alibaba Cloud provides low-cost, high-reliability, and highly-availability storage services for a wide range of storage resources such as blocks, files, and objects. These services are applicable to a variety of scenarios, including data backup, archiving, and disaster recovery. This topic describes the scenarios, performance, security, operations, and cost model of various Alibaba Cloud storage services to help you select the storage service that best meets your business requirements.

For more information about the details, use cases, and solutions of Alibaba Cloud storage services, see [Alibaba Cloud storage services](https://www.aliyun.com/storage/storage).

|[Object Storage Service]()|Object Storage Service \(OSS\) is a secure, cost-effective, and high-durability cloud storage service provided by Alibaba Cloud. It enables you to store a large amount of data in the cloud. OSS provides scalable capacity and processing capability and multiple storage classes to cover a variety of data storage scenarios from hot data to cold data, which help you reduce storage costs.|
|[Block Storage]()|Block Storage is a high-performance, low-latency block storage service for Alibaba Cloud ECS. It supports random read and write operations. You can think of a Block Storage device as a physical disk. You can format a Block Storage device and create a file system on it.|
|[Apsara File Storage NAS]()|Apsara File Storage NAS is a cloud service that provides file storage for compute nodes, including ECS instances, E-HPC nodes, and Alibaba Cloud Container Service for Kubernetes \(ACK\) nodes. It is a distributed file system that provides shared access, elastic scalability, high reliability, and high performance. Apsara File Storage NAS is designed based on POSIX and compatible with native operating systems.|
|[Cloud Paralleled File System]()|Cloud Paralleled File System \(CPFS\) is a type of parallel file system provided by Alibaba Cloud. CPFS stores data across multiple data nodes in a cluster and allows data to be simultaneously accessed by multiple clients. Therefore, CPFS can provide data storage services with high input/output operations per second \(IOPS\), high throughput, and low latency for large and high-performance computing clusters.|
|[Apsara File Storage for HDFS]()|Apsara File Storage for HDFS is a file storage service for computing resources such as Alibaba Cloud ECS instances and Container Service. It can meet the requirements of distributed computing business models such as Hadoop on the performance, capacity, and reliability of distributed storage systems.|
|[Tablestore]()|Tablestore is a data storage service developed by Alibaba Cloud to store a large amount of structured data. You can use Tablestore to efficiently query and analyze data. It can store petabytes of data and provide tens of millions of transactions per second \(TPS\) and milliseconds of latency.|
|[Cloud Storage Gateway]()|Cloud Storage Gateway \(CSG\) is a gateway service that can be deployed at your data center and in Alibaba Cloud. CSG uses Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service \(OSS\) buckets as backend storage devices, and provides on-premises and in-cloud applications with standard file services over the Network File System \(NFS\) and Server Message Block \(SMB\) protocols and block storage services over the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface \(iSCSI\) protocol.|
