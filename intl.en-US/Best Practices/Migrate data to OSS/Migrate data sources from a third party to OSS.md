# Migrate data sources from a third party to OSS

This topic describes how to use Alibaba Cloud Data Online Migration to migrate data from a third-party storage service to OSS or between OSS buckets, such as Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), Google Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Qiniu Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and Baidu Cloud.

To use Data Online Migration, you need only to log on to the Data Transport console, specify information about the source and destination buckets, and create a migration job. After you start a migration job, you can perform management tasks for the job in the console. For example, you can view the migration progress and bandwidth throttling of the job. Additionally, you can use the console to generate a migration report to view the list of migrated files and the list of files that failed to be migrated. For more information about how to migrate data for each data source, see[Data Online Migration](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/zh/product/94157.htm).
