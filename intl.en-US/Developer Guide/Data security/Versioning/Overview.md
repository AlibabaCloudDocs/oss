# Overview

OSS allows you to configure versioning to protect data in buckets. When versioning is enabled for a bucket, data that is overwritten or deleted in the bucket is saved as a previous version. After you configure versioning for a bucket, you can recover objects in the bucket to any previous version to protect your data from being accidentally overwritten or deleted.

## Usage notes

When you use versioning, take note of the following items:

-   Billing

    If you enable versioning for a bucket, you are charged only for the storage of the current versions and previous versions of all objects in the bucket. To avoid unnecessary storage costs, we recommend that you delete the previous versions of objects that you no longer need. Fees are incurred when you download or recover previous versions of an object. Fees include request fees and traffic fees. For more information, see [Billing items and methods](/intl.en-US/Pricing/Billing items and methods/Overview.md).

-   Permissions

    Only the bucket owner or RAM users that have the PutBucketVersioning permission can configure versioning for a bucket.

-   Feature conflicts
    -   Versioning cannot be configured with retention policies or mirroring-based back-to-origin at the same time.
    -   If versioning is enabled for a bucket, the `x-oss-forbid-overwrite` request header that is specified when an object is uploaded to the bucket does not take effect. For more information, see [Request headers](/intl.en-US/API Reference/Object operations/Basic operations/PutObject.md).
-   Supported region

    Versioning is supported in all regions except for Japan \(Tokyo\).

## Versioning status

A bucket can be in one of the following versioning states: disabled, enabled, and suspended.

-   By default, the versioning status of a bucket is unversioned. After versioning is enabled for a bucket, the versioning status of the bucket cannot be set back to disabled. However, you can suspend versioning for a versioned bucket.
-   When an object is uploaded to a bucket for which versioning is enabled, OSS generates a random string as the globally unique version ID of the object. For more information about how to perform operations on objects in a versioned bucket, see [Enable versioning](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Versioning/Enable versioning.md).
-   When an object is uploaded to a bucket for which versioning is suspended, OSS generates a string null as the version ID of the object. For more information about how to perform operations on objects in a bucket for which versioning is suspended, see [Suspend versioning](/intl.en-US/Developer Guide/Data security/Versioning/Suspend versioning.md).

**Note:** In a versioned bucket, all versions of an object are stored, which consume storage spaces and incur storage fees. To reduce storage costs, we recommend that you configure lifecycle rules based on scenarios to delete unnecessary previous versions or convert the storage class of current or previous object versions to IA or Archive. For more information, see [Best practices for versioning](/intl.en-US/Best Practices/Best practices for versioning.md).

## Scenarios

To ensure data security, we recommend that you configure versioning in the following scenarios:

-   Recover deleted data

    OSS does not provide the recycle bin feature. You can configure versioning to recover deleted data.

-   Recover overwritten data

    Online collaborative documents and documents stored in online storage are frequently modified. In online office scenarios, a large number of temporary versions are generated when objects are edited. You can configure versioning to recover data to a specified version of a point in time.


## Data protection

The following table describes how OSS processes deleted and overwritten data in buckets with different versioning states to help you understand the data protection mechanism of versioning.

|Versioning status|Data overwritten|Object deletion|
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
|Disabled|The existing object is overwritten and cannot be recovered. Only the current object version can be accessed.|The object is deleted and cannot be accessed.|
|Enabled|A new version with a unique ID is added for the object. The existing object is stored as a previous version.|A delete marker with a globally unique version ID is added to the object as the current version. The existing object is stored as a previous version.|
|Suspended|A new version with the version ID null is added for the object.If a previous version or delete marker whose version ID is null already exists, the previous version or delete marker is overwritten. Other objects or delete markers whose version IDs are not null are not affected.

|A delete marker with the version ID null is added for the object.If a previous version or delete marker whose version ID is null already exists, the previous version or delete marker is overwritten by the new delete marker. Other objects or delete markers whose version IDs are not null are not affected. |

Figures are used in the following examples to describe how OSS processes data when an object with the same name as that of an existing object is uploaded to or an object is deleted from a bucket for which versioning is enabled or suspended. For ease of viewing, all version IDs in the figures are in the simple format.

-   Overwrite an object in a versioned bucket

    When you upload an object repeatedly to a versioned bucket, the object is overwritten multiple times. A version with a unique version ID is generated for the object each time when the object is overwritten.

-   Delete an object from a versioned bucket

    When you delete an object from a versioned bucket, the previous versions of the object are not deleted and a delete marker is added to the object as the current version to indicate that the object is deleted. If you upload an object with the same name after the delete marker is added, a new version with a unique version ID is added as the current version.

-   Overwrite an object in a bucket for which versioning is suspended

    When you upload an object to a bucket for which versioning is suspended, a new version whose version ID is null is added and the previous versions of the object are retained. If you upload the object with the same name again, a new version whose version ID is null overwrites the current version whose version ID is null.

-   Delete an object from a bucket for which versioning is suspended

    When you delete an object from a bucket for which versioning is suspended, the previous versions of the object are not deleted and a delete marker is added to the object as the current version to indicate that the object is deleted.

    ![4](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/5944169951/p143882.png)


As described in the preceding examples, deleted and overwritten data is stored as previous versions in a bucket whose versioning status is enabled or suspended. After you configure versioning for a bucket, you can recover objects in the bucket to any previous version to protect your data from being accidentally overwritten or deleted.
